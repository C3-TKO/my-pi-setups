# Setup guide
This guide contains all steps to setup my personal H/2 webserver. This is basically a step-by-step checklist of how to set up my personal web server on a Raspberry-Pi 3 Model B in case of a crash.

## Raspberry-Pi Setup
* Download the Ubunutu 16.04 image from: https://ubuntu-pi-flavour-maker.org/download/
* Extract the xz package (xz needs to installed via brew)```unxz ubuntu-16.04-preinstalled-server-armhf+raspi3.img.xz```
* Add the sc cards drive to the Mac and use Apple PiBaker to copy the image to sd card (https://www.tweaking4all.com/software/macosx-software/macosx-apple-pi-baker/)
